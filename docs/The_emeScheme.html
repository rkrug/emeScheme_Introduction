# What is the emeScheme?

---
class: left, top, animated, fadeIn

## What is it?

- metadata **Scheme**
- for **E**cological **M**icrocosm **E**xperiments

--
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

## What does this metada scheme do?

- standardised structure
- standardised terminology / property names
- to describe the an Ecological Microcosm Experiment

--
&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

## What is the metadata?

- Materials
- Conditions / Manipulations
- Measuring
- Data conversions

Adapted from https://www.dataone.org/data-life-cycle

???
- **Plan**: description of the data that will becompiled, and how the data will be managed and made accessible throughout its lifetime

- **Collect**: observations are made either by hand  or with sensors or other instruments  and the data are placed a into digital form

- **Assure**: the quality of the data are assured through checks and inspections

- **Analyze**: data are analyzed

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

- **Preserve**: data are submitted to an appropriate long-term archive (i.e. data center)

- **Discover**: potentially useful data are located and obtained, along with the relevant information about the data 

- **Integrate**: data from disparate sources are combined to form one homogeneous set of data that can be readily analyzed

- **Describe**: data are accurately and thoroughly described using the appropriate metadata standards

## Why do we want this?

- Data should be archived

- Data should be findable

- Data is Re-usable

- We can re-use other data

--

- Data should not disappear

--

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

- Data should be FAIR


---
class: animated, fadeIn 

## What is FAIR?
- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

See [https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) for a detailed description.

???
- To be Findable:

  - F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
  - F2. data are described with rich metadata.
  - F3. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.
  - F4. metadata specify the data identifier.

- TO BE ACCESSIBLE:

  - A1  (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol.
  - A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.
  - A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.
  - A2 metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.

- TO BE INTEROPERABLE:

  - I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
  - I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
  - I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.

- TO BE RE-USABLE:

  - R1. meta(data) have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
  - R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
  - R1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.
  - R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.
